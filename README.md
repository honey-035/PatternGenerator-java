# PatternGenerator-java
# 🎯 Java Pattern Generator

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Java Pattern Generator** is a console-based application that displays **30 unique patterns** (Easy, Medium, and Hard categories) using nested loops and conditional logic.  
It features a **menu-driven interface** with an option to continue after viewing each pattern.  

This project is created as part of **BCA 2nd Year, 3rd Semester** at **Dezyne Ecole College**.
